In order to run these files, you need Python 2.7 and BeautifulSoup Scraper

Welcome to tldr, the place for lazy people to fulfill all their web browsing needs. Is it too much work for
you to read every single word in an article? Use this.

Tldr uses Beautiful Soup Scraper, which uses Python 2.7 in order to scrape the info from web, and articles, 
as well as employing the tf-idf formula in order to determine the importance of every word.

To use the tldr program, download both files, making sure you have the BeautifulSoup scraper installed.
Open the new_scraper file and press f5 in order to run the program. Just type in the url of the article and
the formula will do the rest.
